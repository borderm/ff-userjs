# Firefox User.js patches

I use [ghacks-user.js](https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js) as a template for my firefox config. However, I've found that I'm incapable of keeping my personal copy up-to-date with the changes in master.

Instead I've mapped out every settings I actually changed from their configuration and made patches for each setting.

Further I created a simple shell script to fetch the latest version.
